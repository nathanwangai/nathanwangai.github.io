I am a 2023 Goldwater Scholar and a senior at Johns Hopkins University with dual degrees in biomedical
engineering and applied mathematics. I am amazed by intelligence â€“ its mysterious origins, diverse
forms, and evolving theories. Particularly, I am interested in the research, development, and application
of "NeuroAI" and medical imaging to understand and manage neurodegenerative and other diseases.
